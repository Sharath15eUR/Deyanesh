Network Connectivity Issues

If two devices have the same IP, only one may communicate properly while the other experiences intermittent connectivity or is disconnected.
If both devices actively send data, the network may experience packet collisions or random disconnections.

ARP TABLE


In IPv4, devices use the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.
When a duplicate IP exists, different devices respond to ARP requests with different MAC addresses, leading to constant ARP table updates and confusion in network switches and routers.


Security Risks 

Attackers can exploit IP conflicts by assigning their device the same IP as a gateway or server.
This can intercept sensitive data (Man-in-the-Middle attack) or disrupt legitimate traffic.


TO FIND DUPLICATE IP
find tht duplicate ip using arp -a....two mac address wil have same ip
arp -a | grep "<conflicting-IP>"

TO RESOLVE

sudo dhclient -r
sudo dhclient
