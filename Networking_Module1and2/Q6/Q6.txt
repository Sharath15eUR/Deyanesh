1) VNC (Virtual Network Computing)

Used to connect to a remote system within the same LAN or Wi-Fi.

Requires both VNC server and VNC viewer (e.g., from RealVNC) installed on the respective systems.

The user must set a VNC password during initial server setup.

To connect, the viewer enters the server's IP address and password.

To work across different networks, the server must be accessible via a public IP.

Less secure, as data is not encryptedâ€”only password-protected. A weak password can compromise security.

Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2) AnyDesk & TeamViewer

Easy-to-use applications for remote access over the internet (no need for a shared LAN).

Each device is assigned a unique ID, and connections require entering this ID.

Access must be accepted by the remote user; an optional password can be set for unattended access.

Offers AES encryption, making it more secure than VNC.

Cross-platform support: Windows, Linux, macOS.

3) RDC (Remote Desktop Connection)

A built-in tool in Windows for remote access.

Requires devices to be on the same LAN or Wi-Fi network.

Offers strong security and seamless integration with the Windows environment.

Limited to Windows-to-Windows connections.
